# machine-level-optimizations

These are highly optimized implementations of two popular algorithms: merge sort and matrix multiplication. These implementations use various techniques to reduce running time and memory consumption.

_NOTE: Several of these optimizations may automatically be performed by your compiler, when compiled at higher optimation levels (`-O1` or `-O2` flags). This effort was a part of a course to learn about these optimizations, hence these programs achieve optimal performance even without compiler optimization (when compiled with `-O0` flag)._
